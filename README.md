# 🚀 FastAPI Learning Plan and Notes

This repository documents my learning plan and notes for starting with **FastAPI** as a Python developer.

## ✅ 1️⃣ What is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance Python framework for building APIs quickly and with automatic validation and documentation.  
- Built on Starlette (web) and Pydantic (validation).  
- Supports async and sync routes.  
- Generates interactive docs automatically.

# 🚀 FastAPI Basics Walkthrough

This repo is a step-by-step guide to learning **FastAPI fundamentals**, one concept at a time.

Each Python file in the `app/` folder covers a single topic, like:

- ✅ Type hints in route functions
- ✅ HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
- ✅ Returning status codes
- ✅ Handling headers
- ✅ Working with JSON
- ✅ REST API structure
- ✅ Pydantic models for validation
